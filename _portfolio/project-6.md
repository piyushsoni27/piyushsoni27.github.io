* Gesture Recognition cum Hand Tracking system that could trace the movement of hands. The gesture could be deciphered and particular actions/commands could be executed accordingly.
* Used HSV colour space for skin segmentation and Heuristic thresholding for Binary Segmentation and mean-shift algorithm for Hand Tracking.
* Used this Hand Gesture Recognition system to develop a calculator which can solve complex mathematical expressions, with BODMAS implementation.
* **Technologies:** Python, OpenCV
